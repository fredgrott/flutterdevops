# Flutter DevOPS

Due to the amount of flutter community stuff we need to be on 
top of the flutter SDK; devops evolves into both accessory tools configuration and flutter app libary configuration so that we 
can dev and design flutter apps in fast fashion.

Hence, this repo covers this mixed flutter devOPS.
